Assume there are N players, who have been ordered according to the order in which they will play by some random means (e.g., by rolling the dice, drawing straws, etc.)\n\n2. Players all start at position 0.\n\n3. At time k (k = 0, 1, 2, ...) the positions of the N players are indicated by p_n(k) for n = 1, 2, 3, ..., N.\n\n4. Starting with player 1, each player throws a die and adds the value shown on the die to his position, i.e., p_1(k+1) = p_1(k) + {the roll of the die}. Then the player moves to that position on the board. If there is no chute or ladder at the new position, he remains there and his turn ends. On the other hand, if there is a chute or a ladder at the new position, the player must climb the ladder or fall down the chute as the case may be .... this change then yields the new position.\n\n5. The first player to reach position 100 exactly wins the game. If a player rolls the die and computes a new position that would take her past 100, then the roll is voided and she remains at her original position."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Following is a function which rolls the die and computes the new position of a player."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import random\nfrom random import Random\n\nrandom.seed(a=None,version=2)","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This needs to be included for the random drawing of numbers from\n# 1 to 6 simulating the throw of a die.\nimport random\nfrom random import Random\n\nrandom.seed(a=None,version=2)\n\n# This dictionary stores the chutes and ladders board.\nCandLTable = {1:38, 4:14, 9:31, 16:6, 21:42, 28:84, 36:44, 47:26, 49:11, 51:67,\n             56:53, 63:19, 64:60, 71:91, 80:100, 87:24, 93:73, 95:75, 98:78}\n\n# The function to make a move\ndef CandL_make_a_move(position,CandLTable):\n    rand = Random(None)\n    roll = rand.randint(1, 6)\n    if position + roll > 100:\n        return position\n    position += roll\n    position = CandLTable.get(position, position)\n    return position","execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# HW Problem: Program Chutes and Ladders Game\n\nWrite a program which plays a game between two people until one wins and produces a record of the game play.\n\nIf you have time convert your single game code into a function and then write a program to play a large number of games one after another keeping a record of who won and how long the game lasted.
